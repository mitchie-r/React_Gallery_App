This project displays photos from Flickr to the screen. It has three navigation buttons
to display phots of cats, dogs, or computers. There's also a search bar to search for photos. If
no photos are found a messagage will be displayed. There's also a custom NotFound page if the page
does not exist with a route.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
